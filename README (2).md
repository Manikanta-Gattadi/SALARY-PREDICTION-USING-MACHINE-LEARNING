# Salary Prediction Using Machine Learning 🎯

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on building a **Salary Prediction System** using **Linear Regression**. It predicts employee salaries based on factors such as **years of experience, education level, and job role**. The main objective is to demonstrate how machine learning techniques can be applied in **human resource management and career planning** to generate data-driven insights.

## 🚀 Features
- Predicts salaries based on input features like experience, education, and job title.
- Implements **Linear Regression** using `scikit-learn`.
- Includes **data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation**.
- Evaluates performance with metrics such as **MSE, RMSE, MAE, and R² score**.
- Provides testing strategies including **cross-validation, regression assumption testing, and outlier detection**.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Programming Language:** Python 3.x
- **Libraries & Tools:**
  - NumPy
  - Pandas
  - Matplotlib
  - Scikit-learn
- **Development Environment:** Jupyter Notebook / PyCharm / VS Code

## 📂 System Requirements
**Hardware:**
- Processor: Intel Core i3 or higher
- RAM: Minimum 4GB
- Storage: 500MB free space

**Software:**
- OS: Windows / Linux / macOS
- Python 3.x installed with required libraries

## 📊 Workflow
1. **Dataset Preparation** – Import and clean the salary dataset.
2. **Exploratory Analysis** – Understand feature relationships (experience vs. salary).
3. **Model Training** – Apply Linear Regression.
4. **Model Testing** – Evaluate with metrics & cross-validation.
5. **Prediction** – Use the trained model to estimate new salaries.
